  description: 'Yes, I trust the frontier models — I run them every day and I know what they produce. But calibrated confidence is still personal, not proof about the system.

  html: `<div class="post-tldr"><p><strong>TL;DR</strong> Yes, I trust the frontier models: I put them through their paces daily, across very different scenarios. That trust is calibrated, which is the opposite of blind — and it proves nothing, because it says something about me and nothing about the software. On regulated healthcare software, quality is a set of properties that must hold on every single change: an audit trail that stands up in court, an identity nobody can forge, accessibility as a legal obligation, interoperability contracts that do not lie. Not one of them depends on who wrote the line. So I stopped defending them by reading diffs and started compiling them. 67 recorded decisions, 39 checks that fail the build, one pre-merge verdict, and exactly one perimeter where the answer is deliberately a human. We measure one thing: which stage each defect is caught at. Two of those stages are still empty — we are not live, and the first on-site tests are weeks away. Review itself is mostly agents reviewing agents; what is left to people is what a machine cannot carry — the opposable and security calls. The point was never to slow down. It is to go faster and better at once.</p></div>
<hr>
<p>Yes, I trust the frontier models. I put them through their paces every day, across very different scenarios, and I know fairly precisely what they produce: where they are excellent, where they drift, what comes back when the brief is bad. There is nothing blind about that trust. It is the product of daily calibration.</p>
<p>And it proves nothing.</p>
<p>My confidence is a fact about me, not a property of the software. It does not transfer, it cannot be audited, and it is worth nothing to someone asking how we guarantee that an audit record gets written. That is why I no longer read diffs line by line, and why I built something else instead.</p>

<h2>What quality means here</h2>
<p>I lead engineering on <abbr title="Fictitious codename: the real project, its products and its vendor are anonymized.">Solstice*</abbr>, a hospital <abbr title="Enterprise Resource Planning — the administrative backbone of a hospital group">ERP</abbr> for a French public hospital group. That context decides the whole definition.</p>
<p>Quality here is not a score and not a defect count. It is a short list of properties that have to be true after every change, without exception:</p>
<ul>
<li>Writes that can be held against us later carry a legal audit trail, and the write is refused if the trail cannot be written.</li>
<li>A user's identity is never inferred from something the caller can type.</li>
<li>Regulated fields are never returned in the clear.</li>
<li>Accessibility is not a nice-to-have. In French public procurement it is a legal obligation with a named standard.</li>
<li>The interoperability contract we publish describes what the deployment actually serves.</li>
</ul>
<p>Not one of those is verified by asking "does the feature work". Each is a property of the system that a perfectly working feature can silently violate. That is the whole problem, and it existed long before agents.</p>
<blockquote><p>Quality is not the absence of bugs. It is the set of properties that survive the next change.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Why reading stopped being the instrument</h2>
<p>Two reasons, and only one is about volume. Volume is real and everyone has said it: more code arrives each week than any team reads with genuine attention.</p>
<p>The second survives even with infinite reading time. Reading a diff is an instrument for finding a wrong line. The defects that get through are usually a <em>missing</em> line, in a file the diff never opened.</p>
<blockquote><p>You cannot notice an absence in a document that does not contain it.</p></blockquote>
<p>Almost half our checks exist because the obligation spans files. A resource class announced in the public contract obliges a service address provisioned in the deployment file. A port published next to the gateway silently removes the authentication the gateway performs. The change under review is locally correct; the obligation lives where the reviewer is not looking. That is exactly where human review is weakest and a script strongest.</p>
<p>One finding changed how I read a proposal. A study accepted at <abbr title="Mining Software Repositories — a peer-reviewed software-engineering conference">MSR</abbr> 2026 measured that agent-written pull requests carry noticeably more redundant code — and that reviewers rated them <em>more</em> favourably than human ones. Idiomatic, well-commented code buys less suspicion than it has earned. It is plausible before it is correct, and plausibility is what a reviewer stops on.</p>
<p>None of which makes it a new species of defect: a tired engineer forgets the same call on a Friday afternoon. What changed is the rate of the omission and the cost of catching it by reading.</p>

<h2>The 4 layers</h2>
<p>None of this is a verdict on the models. Those properties have to hold whoever wrote the line — an agent, a senior engineer, or me on a Friday evening. So they no longer rest on anyone's attention. They rest on code that runs.</p>
<p><strong>67 recorded decisions.</strong> Dated, versioned, read by every agent before anything structural. They carry the <em>reason</em> — the part an agent otherwise refactors away because it looks like an accident. No human on the team reads all 67. I do not either.</p>
<p><strong>39 blocking checks</strong>, inside 44 continuous-integration jobs. One per property, each born of a real mistake. A single design rule governs them, and it is the only transferable thing in this post: <strong>derive the perimeter from the code, never recopy it</strong>. A hand-maintained list is wrong one rename later, and it fails silently.</p>
<p><strong>1 verdict before the merge.</strong> One command, scoped to the diff, in parity with the pipeline, printing PASS or FAIL. It does not prove the change is good; it converts "please have a look" into a claim someone can check.</p>
<p><strong>1 human perimeter, on purpose.</strong> The surface reachable from outside the hospital information system: static entry secret, destructive delete. Review by a non-author, mandatory. We could have written a script; we decided that mistake should cost a conversation.</p>
<p>A word on review, because the word misleads. On my team it is overwhelmingly automated: agents review agents and file a report. The human does not read the lines. The human reads what happened, and owns what a machine cannot own — the opposable calls and the security trade-offs.</p>
<blockquote><p>Responsibility does not delegate to a model.</p></blockquote>
<p>None of this exists to slow anyone down, and I would drop all of it tomorrow if it did. An executable rule is what lets us merge without a meeting. Speed and quality are not traded against each other here: they move together.</p>

<h2>How we prove it</h2>
<p>"We have guardrails" is a claim, not evidence. A system that enforces properties has to be measured, or it is just architecture with good intentions.</p>
<p>We measure on one ladder: <strong>how many stages a defect clears before something catches it.</strong> 6 rungs, in order — the pipeline, code review, manual testing, formal <abbr title="Quality Assurance — the qualification stage before a release is accepted">QA</abbr>, the pilot site, and production. Every defect is labelled with the rung that caught it. Everything else we track hangs off that: defect density against merged proposals, time to fix by severity, the reopen rate, the standing backlog.</p>
<p>The rightmost two rungs get their own name, and it is the only number I would defend in a steering committee: <strong>escaped defects</strong>. Anything found at the pilot or in production escaped every net we own.</p>
<p>This reframes what a guardrail is <em>for</em>. A check is not there to reduce a defect count. It is there to move one class of defect permanently leftward — from "a tester finds it" to "the build refuses it" — and it never moves back. That is why the count of executable rules matters more than the count of bugs. Bugs are a flow. Rules are a ratchet.</p>
<blockquote><p>The question is not how many defects we found. It is how far each one got before something stopped it.</p></blockquote>

<h2>What none of this proves</h2>
<p><strong>My confidence does not transfer.</strong> It does not exist for the person who joins on Monday, nor for a model I have not put through its paces, nor for me on a subject I know badly. The checks are what remains when my calibration is absent.</p>
<p><strong>It is a ratchet, not a net.</strong> 39 checks encode 39 defects already paid for. Each exists precisely because it did not. We cannot repeat 39 specific mistakes — which says nothing about the ones nobody has noticed yet.</p>
<p><strong>The verdict is narrow.</strong> PASS means no <em>known</em> rule is violated. The end-to-end phase runs against mocks, never a real database. Several of the defects that taught us most would have sailed through it.</p>
<p><strong>The last two stages are empty because we have not reached them yet.</strong> Nothing escaped to a pilot site or to production because there is neither, yet. The first on-site tests are a few weeks away. That is when those two columns start filling, and when I find out what everything above is actually worth. The hardest evidence — what survives real users on real hospital data — is evidence we do not have. Anyone showing a leakage chart with the last two columns empty is showing a calendar, not a result. Including me.</p>
<p><strong>Checks catch the disease they treat.</strong> One of ours came from a schema change that only applied to freshly created databases: green in the pipeline, green locally, broken everywhere else. Its first version had a blind spot of exactly the same shape.</p>
<p><strong>Derogations are not counted.</strong> About 12 are in use, each with a written reason beside it. Exactly one check counts them over time. Nothing prevents an agent from writing its own exemption to turn itself green. That is the open flaw in everything above, and I have no fix for it.</p>

<h2>What still belongs to humans</h2>
<p>Being surprised first. Every one of these checks exists because a person felt something was off and went looking. No rule has ever written the first rule.</p>
<p>Deciding what a defect means. That a control cannot be reached with a keyboard is a technical fact. That it puts us in breach of a legal accessibility obligation, and therefore blocks a release instead of joining a backlog, is a judgement.</p>
<p>Judging a derogation. An exemption marked in the code is auditable only if somebody goes and reads it — the marker does not audit itself.</p>
<p>Signing. An opposable decision commits somebody, and a model cannot be that somebody. That is not a limit of the current generation. It is what the word means.</p>
<p>And the question no check asks: whether the thing should exist at all.</p>
<p>None of this is an argument for fewer people. People are the ones who get surprised first, and being surprised is the only part of this that does not scale by writing more scripts.</p>

<h2>What to do Monday morning</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Write down the properties, not the process.</strong> Five sentences that must stay true after every change. If you cannot name them, no amount of tooling will protect them.</li>
<li><strong>Label every defect with the stage that caught it.</strong> One field, and the highest-value measurement in this post. Without it you count bugs instead of measuring reach.</li>
<li><strong>Take one incident you already paid for and make it fail the build this week.</strong> Not a policy. One incident, one script.</li>
<li><strong>Prefer the obligations that cross files</strong>, and derive every perimeter from the code. Anything you maintain by hand drifts, and it drifts quietly.</li>
<li><strong>Count your derogations against a baseline that can only go down.</strong> I have one of those. I should have 40.</li>

<hr>
<p>Oui, je fais confiance aux modèles de tête. Je les éprouve tous les jours, sur des scénarios très différents, et je sais assez précisément ce qu'ils produisent : où ils sont excellents, où ils dérapent, ce qu'ils rendent quand la consigne est mauvaise. Cette confiance n'a rien d'aveugle. Elle est le résultat d'un étalonnage quotidien.</p>
<p>Et elle ne prouve rien.</p>
<p>Ma confiance est un fait sur moi, pas une propriété du logiciel. Elle ne se transmet pas, elle ne s'audite pas, et elle ne vaudra rien devant quelqu'un qui demande comment nous garantissons qu'une trace d'audit est écrite. C'est pour cela que je ne relis plus les diffs ligne à ligne, et que j'ai construit autre chose à la place.</p>

<h2>Ce que « qualité » veut dire ici</h2>
<p>Je dirige l'ingénierie sur <abbr title="Nom de code fictif : le projet réel, ses produits et son éditeur sont anonymisés.">Solstice*</abbr>, un <abbr title="Enterprise Resource Planning — la colonne vertébrale administrative d'un groupement hospitalier">ERP</abbr> hospitalier pour un groupement public. Ce contexte décide de toute la définition.</p>
<p>Ici, la qualité n'est ni une note ni un décompte de défauts. C'est une courte liste de propriétés qui doivent être vraies après chaque changement, sans exception :</p>
<ul>
<li>Une écriture qui peut nous être opposée porte une trace d'audit légale, et l'écriture est refusée si la trace ne peut pas être écrite.</li>
<li>L'identité d'un utilisateur ne se déduit jamais de quelque chose que l'appelant peut taper.</li>
<li>Les champs régulés ne sortent jamais en clair.</li>
<li>L'accessibilité n'est pas un confort. Dans la commande publique française, c'est une obligation légale avec un référentiel nommé.</li>
<li>Le contrat d'interopérabilité que nous publions décrit ce que le déploiement sert réellement.</li>
</ul>
<p>Aucune de ces propriétés ne se vérifie en demandant « est-ce que la fonctionnalité marche ». Chacune peut être violée en silence par une fonctionnalité qui marche parfaitement. C'est tout le problème, et il existait bien avant les agents.</p>
<blockquote><p>La qualité n'est pas l'absence de bogues. C'est l'ensemble des propriétés qui survivent au changement suivant.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Pourquoi la relecture a cessé d'être l'instrument</h2>
<p>Deux raisons, et une seule concerne le volume. Le volume est réel et tout le monde l'a constaté : il arrive chaque semaine plus de code qu'aucune équipe n'en lit vraiment.</p>
<p>La seconde tient même avec un temps de lecture infini. Relire un diff est un instrument fait pour trouver une ligne fausse. Les défauts qui passent sont le plus souvent une ligne <em>manquante</em>, dans un fichier que le diff n'a jamais ouvert.</p>
<blockquote><p>On ne remarque pas une absence dans un document qui ne la contient pas.</p></blockquote>
<p>Près de la moitié de nos contrôles existent parce que l'obligation traverse les fichiers. Une classe annoncée dans le contrat public oblige à provisionner une adresse dans le fichier de déploiement. Un port publié à côté de la passerelle supprime silencieusement l'authentification qu'elle assure. Le changement relu est localement correct ; l'obligation vit là où le relecteur ne regarde pas. C'est exactement là que la revue humaine est au plus faible et un script au plus fort.</p>
<p>Un résultat a changé ma façon de lire une proposition. Une étude acceptée à <abbr title="Mining Software Repositories — conférence de génie logiciel à comité de lecture">MSR</abbr> 2026 mesure que les propositions écrites par des agents portent nettement plus de code redondant — et que les relecteurs les ont jugées <em>plus</em> favorablement que celles des humains. Un code idiomatique et bien commenté inspire moins de méfiance qu'il n'en mériterait. Il est plausible avant d'être juste, et c'est sur la plausibilité que le relecteur s'arrête.</p>
<p>Ce n'est pas une nouvelle espèce de défaut pour autant : un ingénieur fatigué oublie le même appel un vendredi après-midi. Ce qui a changé, c'est la cadence de l'omission et le coût de sa détection par la lecture.</p>

<h2>Les 4 couches</h2>
<p>Rien de tout cela n'est un jugement sur les modèles. Ces propriétés doivent tenir quel que soit l'auteur de la ligne : un agent, un ingénieur chevronné, ou moi un vendredi soir. Elles ne reposent donc plus sur l'attention de quelqu'un, mais sur du code qui s'exécute.</p>
<p><strong>67 décisions consignées.</strong> Datées, versionnées, lues par chaque agent avant tout changement structurant. Elles portent la <em>raison</em> — la partie qu'un agent supprime au premier remaniement parce qu'elle ressemble à un accident. Aucun humain de l'équipe ne lit les 67. Moi non plus.</p>
<p><strong>39 contrôles bloquants</strong>, dans 44 travaux d'intégration continue. Un par propriété, chacun né d'une erreur réelle. Une seule règle de conception les gouverne, et c'est la seule chose transposable de ce billet : <strong>dériver le périmètre du code, jamais le recopier</strong>. Une liste tenue à la main est fausse un renommage plus tard, et elle échoue en silence.</p>
<p><strong>1 verdict avant la fusion.</strong> Une commande cadrée sur le diff, en parité avec la chaîne, qui imprime PASS ou FAIL. Elle ne prouve pas que le changement est bon : elle transforme « jette un œil » en une affirmation vérifiable.</p>
<p><strong>1 périmètre humain, exprès.</strong> La surface joignable de l'extérieur, secret d'entrée statique et suppression destructrice. Revue obligatoire par un non-auteur. Nous aurions pu écrire un script ; nous avons décidé que cette erreur-là devait coûter une conversation.</p>
<p>Un mot sur la revue, parce que le mot induit en erreur. Chez nous elle est très majoritairement automatisée : des agents relisent des agents et rendent un rapport. L'humain ne lit pas les lignes, il lit ce qui s'est passé — et il assume ce qu'une machine ne peut pas assumer, l'opposable et la sécurité.</p>
<blockquote><p>Une responsabilité ne se délègue pas à un modèle.</p></blockquote>
<p>Rien de tout cela n'existe pour ralentir, et j'abandonnerais l'ensemble demain si c'était le cas. Une règle exécutable est ce qui permet de fusionner sans réunion. La vélocité et la qualité ne s'échangent pas ici : elles montent ensemble.</p>

<h2>Comment on le prouve</h2>
<p>« Nous avons des garde-fous » est une affirmation, pas une preuve. Un système qui impose des propriétés doit être mesuré, sinon ce n'est que de l'architecture pleine de bonnes intentions.</p>
<p>Nous mesurons sur une seule échelle : <strong>combien d'étapes un défaut franchit avant que quelque chose l'attrape.</strong> 6 étapes, dans l'ordre — la chaîne, la revue de code, le test manuel, la <abbr title="Quality Assurance — l'étape de qualification avant acceptation d'une livraison">recette</abbr>, le client pilote, la production. Chaque défaut porte l'étape qui l'a attrapé. Tout le reste en découle : densité de défauts rapportée aux propositions fusionnées, délai de correction par sévérité, taux de réouverture, backlog ouvert.</p>
<p>Les deux dernières étapes ont leur propre nom, et c'est le seul chiffre que je défendrais en comité de pilotage : les <strong>défauts échappés</strong>. Tout ce qui est trouvé chez le pilote ou en production a échappé à tous nos filets.</p>
<p>Cela redéfinit ce à quoi sert un garde-fou. Un contrôle n'est pas là pour faire baisser un décompte. Il est là pour déplacer une classe de défauts définitivement vers la gauche — de « un testeur le trouve » à « la compilation le refuse » — et cela ne revient jamais en arrière. Voilà pourquoi le nombre de règles exécutables compte davantage que le nombre de bogues. Un bogue corrigé peut revenir. Une règle écrite, non.</p>
<blockquote><p>La question n'est pas combien de défauts nous avons trouvés. C'est jusqu'où chacun est allé avant que quelque chose l'arrête.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Ce que tout cela ne prouve pas</h2>
<p><strong>Ma confiance ne se transmet pas.</strong> Elle n'existe pas chez la personne qui arrive lundi, ni pour un modèle que je n'ai pas encore éprouvé, ni pour moi sur un sujet que je maîtrise mal. Les contrôles sont ce qui reste quand mon étalonnage n'est pas là.</p>
<p><strong>Ça n'attrape pas tout, ça empêche de retomber.</strong> 39 contrôles encodent 39 défauts déjà payés. Chacun existe parce qu'il n'existait pas. Nous ne pouvons plus refaire 39 erreurs précises — cela ne dit rien de celles que personne n'a encore remarquées.</p>
<p><strong>Le verdict est étroit.</strong> PASS signifie qu'aucune règle <em>connue</em> n'est violée. La phase de bout en bout tourne sur des bouchons, jamais sur une vraie base. Plusieurs des défauts qui nous ont le plus appris seraient passés au travers.</p>
<p><strong>Les deux dernières étapes sont vides parce que nous n'y sommes pas encore arrivés.</strong> Rien ne s'est échappé chez un client pilote ni en production, pour la bonne raison qu'il n'y a encore ni l'un ni l'autre. Les premiers tests sur site sont dans quelques semaines. C'est là que ces deux colonnes commenceront à se remplir, et que je saurai ce que tout ce qui précède vaut vraiment. La preuve la plus dure — ce qui survit à de vrais utilisateurs, sur de vraies données hospitalières — nous ne l'avons pas. Quiconque montre un tableau de détection avec les deux dernières colonnes vides montre un calendrier, pas un résultat. Moi compris.</p>
<p><strong>Les contrôles attrapent la maladie qu'ils soignent.</strong> L'un des nôtres est né d'un changement de schéma qui ne s'appliquait qu'aux bases neuves : vert en chaîne, vert en local, cassé partout ailleurs. Sa première version avait un angle mort exactement de la même forme.</p>
<p><strong>Les dérogations ne sont pas comptées.</strong> Environ 12 sont en usage, chacune avec sa raison écrite à côté. Un seul contrôle les compte dans le temps. Rien n'empêche un agent d'écrire sa propre exemption pour se rendre vert. C'est la faille ouverte de tout ce qui précède, et je n'ai pas de correctif.</p>
<h2>Ce qui reste aux humains</h2>
<p>Être surpris le premier. Chacun de ces contrôles existe parce qu'une personne a senti que quelque chose clochait et est allée regarder. Aucune règle n'a jamais écrit la première règle.</p>
<p>Décider ce qu'un défaut signifie. Qu'un contrôle ne soit pas atteignable au clavier est un fait technique. Que cela nous mette en défaut sur une obligation légale d'accessibilité, et bloque donc une livraison au lieu de rejoindre un backlog, est un jugement.</p>
<p>Juger une dérogation. Une exemption marquée dans le code n'est auditable que si quelqu'un va la lire — le marqueur ne s'audite pas tout seul.</p>
<p>Signer. Une décision opposable engage quelqu'un, et un modèle ne peut pas être ce quelqu'un. Ce n'est pas une limite de la génération actuelle. C'est le sens du mot.</p>
<p>Et la question qu'aucun contrôle ne pose : est-ce que ça devrait exister.</p>
<p>Rien de tout cela n'est un argument pour moins de monde. Ce sont les gens qui sont surpris les premiers, et être surpris est la seule partie de tout ceci qui ne passe pas à l'échelle en écrivant plus de scripts.</p>

<h2>Quoi faire lundi matin</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Écrivez les propriétés, pas le processus.</strong> Cinq phrases qui doivent rester vraies après chaque changement. Si vous ne savez pas les nommer, aucun outillage ne les protégera.</li>
<li><strong>Étiquetez chaque défaut avec l'étape qui l'a attrapé.</strong> Un champ, et c'est la mesure la plus rentable de tout ce billet. Sans elle, vous comptez des bogues au lieu de mesurer leur portée.</li>
<li><strong>Prenez un incident déjà payé et faites-le échouer la compilation cette semaine.</strong> Pas une politique. Un incident, un script.</li>
<li><strong>Préférez les obligations qui traversent les fichiers</strong>, et dérivez chaque périmètre du code. Tout ce qu'on tient à la main dérive, et ça dérive sans bruit.</li>
<li><strong>Comptez vos dérogations contre une référence qui ne peut que décroître.</strong> J'en ai un. Je devrais en avoir 40.</li>
